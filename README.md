# ADA-TG

**Astronomical Data Analysis & TerraGuard**

To collect and analyse predominantly space, orbital and terrestrial data, including **but not limited to**: solar activity, geomagnetic storms, cosmic rays, natural disasters and weather anomalies.
*Protecting our humanity*.

**In depth**:

The dual system will use Machine Learning where necessary and live API analytical data to present *and make predictions* on current and rising trends that may hint at signs of threats against humanity via routine calls and local logging. Immediate notices when flags have been met will be sent out these flags are based on thresholds, analytical data and predictive modelling. An example case would be; the National Grid power analysed over a given period, if it falls under a given threshold and trends indicate power outages itâ€™ll alert and report in advance as a warning using predictive modelling, or warn of low energy periods in the grid system.


The goal for ADA-TG is to collect and analyse predominantly space, orbital and terrestrial data, including **but not limited to**: solar activity, geomagnetic storms, cosmic rays, natural disasters and weather anomalies. Machine Learning capabilities to predict trends and future abnormalities based on previously logged data are a supplementary long-term feature to incorporate.

Sudden increases in density, total interplanetary magnetic field (*IMF*) strength, and solar wind speed reported by the DSCOVR spacecraft owned by Government Agency NASA to indicate the arrival of CME-associated interplanetary shocks ahead of the rolling magnetic cloud - if ADA can predict rising trends in conjunction with DSCOVRs data it could lead to real-world protective measures being put in place.

The duo project was born from the NASA Space Apps Challenge in which Michael Asker (*citizen-scientist and cyber security analyst*) and Newt Powers (*private research Jr at Cornell University and engineer*) led a joint effort on the proposal for such a program being developed. This is now being continued in the AskerDyne Lab allowing for eventual open collaboration with other independent parties, agencies, associations, and organisations which may find use cases for such software.
